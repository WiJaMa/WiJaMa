### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I'm a Statistics and China studies student with research interests in conspiracy theories in the Sinosphere.
 - In my free time, I've also contributed writing to video game projects, none of which really got off the ground.  You can see a little bit of it in Dibujaron's [Distant Horizon](https://github.com/Dibujaron/DistantHorizonServer).
 - I'm mostly here for class, but I'm happy to collaborate on statistics and machine learning projects, particularly if they have to do with China or Taiwan.
